h1. Weakling

Weakling is a simple prototype-based javascript plugin to measure the strength of a password.

I significantly modified "Frane's":http://github.com/frane plugin called "password_strength_meter":http://github.com/frane/password_strength_meter/
I didn't want a percentage bar so I stripped that out, I refactored the helper to be more readable. It passes a hash instead of array for strength text Its supports locales.
